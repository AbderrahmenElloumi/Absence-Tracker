#Please Make sure you have node.js installed because i don't know how to build the app, and i have no idea how to use git LMAO 
If you're looking for a desperate way to track your absences (w taaref rouhek taya7 éliminé walle), please start by cloning the repo (or use git clone <HTTPS Link>)
Then you can do git checkout <Whatever Branch Title you want to use>
git pull origin <Whatever Branch Title you want to use>
npm install 
npm start and voila!

P.S: You can also make .bat file, insert this script in it:
      @echo off
      cd /d %~dp0
      npm start
      pause
Then Right-Click on it in the file explorer and make a shortcut out of it, then move it to your desktop for easy access :)
